# Stock Analysis Dashboard
Note : 
<br>
1. You do not have to scrape the data for the entire stock list.
2. Just scrape data for one stock. (example: in our case Bharati Airtel)
3. There are no restrictions for using libraries as long as it is open source
4. You can take help of anyone in our group if you want
